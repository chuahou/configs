\section*{Question 5.1}

\subsection*{Part (a)}

Using the partial chain rule, we note that (setting
$\bm{g}(\bm{y}) = \bm{\mathrm{M}y}$):
\begin{align*}
	\dydx{f(\br{M}\bm{y})}{\bm{y}} (\bm{y_n}) &=
	\dydx{(f \circ \bm{g})}{\bm{y}} (\bm{y_n}) \\
	&= \br{J}(\bm{g})\trans
		\left(\dydx{f}{\bm{x}} \circ \bm{g}\right) (\bm{y_n})
		\reason{partial chain rule} \\
	&= \br{MJ}(\bm{y})\trans
		\dydx{f}{\bm{x}}(\bm{\mathrm{M}y}) \\
	&= \br{MI} \dydx{f}{\bm{x}}(\bm{x_n}) \\
	&= \br{M} \dydx{f}{\bm{x}}(\bm{x_n}). \numberthis \label{eqn1}
\end{align*}
Hence $\bm{x_n}$ can be computed directly using the preconditioned iteration.

Gradient descent for $\operatorname{arg\,min}_{\bm{y}} f(\bm{\mathrm{M}y})$
yields
\begin{align*}
	&&\bm{y_{n+1}} &= \bm{y_n} -
		\alpha_n \dydx{f(\br{M}\bm{y})}{\bm{x}} (\bm{y_n}) \\
	&\Rightarrow&\br{M}^{-1} \bm{x_{n+1}} &= \br{M}^{-1} \bm{x_n} -
		\alpha_n \br{M} \dydx{f}{\bm{x}} (\bm{x_n})
		\reason{substituting $\bm{x_n} = \br{M} \bm{y_n}$
			and \eqref{eqn1}} \\
	&\Rightarrow&\bm{x_{n+1}} &= \bm{x_n} -
		\alpha_n \br{M}^2 \dydx{f}{\bm{x}} (\bm{x_n})
		\reason{multiplying through by $\br{M}$}
\end{align*}
which proves ($*$).

\section*{Question 2}

We modify BFS to check if there are edges between vertices of depths of the
same parity. Since $G$ is a directed graph that is strongly connected, we are
certain that $G$ contains a cycle. Hence we only need to check that at least one
edge between vertices of the same depth parity exist to know that an odd cycle
exists.
