# Common config files

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/no-ragrets.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

These are some config files I use on Linux that I am hosting here in case I
need to work on a different Linux machine.

To use, copy the files to the home directory and add `.` to the front of the
file name. For example,

```cp ./profile ~/.profile```

while in this repository directory.
